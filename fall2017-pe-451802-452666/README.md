### Experiments that we want to perform ###

 - Apache web server performance evaluation on different AWS instance types
 - Reason: Finding what factors affecting the performance of web server helps us undstancer how hardware impacts on the performance of a server 
 - MongoDB performance evaluation on different instance types
 - Reason: Poor database query is a important factor that result the
 - bottlenceck of webpage performance
### Experiments Platform ###

 - We will use the web development tool Apache Bench to maesure several aspects of the performance 
 - including reading and writing (insertion and query).
 - We will use about 4-6 different AWS ec2 instances to show the impact of using different 
 - CPU, storage, networking on the performance of the web server. Specifically, we will compare ecah instances' CPU, mermory and storage
 - and thrie performance of the web server (like requests and inserts)
